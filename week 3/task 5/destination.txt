# Buffer:

- A Buffer in nodejs is a temporary storage of binary data. it useful when dealing with file handling, network packets, and streams.

- Advantage
    - Handle raw binary data.
    - provide efficient memory usage.
    - Allow manipulation of binary data before converting it to a string.

# Stream:

- A stream is data handling method that allow reading or writing data in chunks rather than loading the entire file into memory.

- Advantage
    - Efficient for large files.
    - reduce memory consumption.
    - Increases performance by processing data as it arrives.

# Reading files using fs modules:

- Synchronous: fs.readFileSync - Block execution until the operation completes.

- Asynchronous: fs.readFile - Non-blocking, uses callbacks.

- Using Streams: fs.createReadStream - Read files in chunks
